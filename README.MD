 # MarketMomentum-SwiftUI

This project demonstrates a simple SwiftUI application that allows users to enter a stock symbol and displays the stock price using data fetched from an external API. The app uses SwiftUI for its UI components and makes network requests to retrieve stock information.

## Overview
The application consists of two main components:

* ContentView: The main view of the application, responsible for displaying the UI elements and handling user interactions.
* StockWebService: A class responsible for fetching stock data from an external API.

## Getting Started
To run this project, you'll need Xcode installed on your Mac. Follow these steps to get started:

Open the project in Xcode.
Ensure you have a valid internet connection to access the external API.
Run the project by selecting a simulator or connecting an iOS device.

## Features
Stock Symbol Input: Users can input a stock symbol (e.g., "AAPL" for Apple Inc.) to query the stock price.
Fetch Stock Data: Upon entering a stock symbol and pressing the "Find" button, the app fetches the latest stock price from an external API.
Display Stock Price: The fetched stock price is displayed prominently on the screen.
